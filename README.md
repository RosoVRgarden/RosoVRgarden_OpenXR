# RosoVRgarden_OpenXR

OpenXR template that works on both the Oculus Quest and the HTC Vive Pro. It uses locomotion (action based), direct interactables, ray interactables and numerous objects (cabinet, door) that use events to change sound and materials. 

Requires: Unity 2020.3 with Interactive Toolkit
Issue: physics vs interactive layers
Future: more programming examples
